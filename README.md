# RizzLang Programming Language

**RizzLang** is the easiest and most fun way to start coding! Unlike Python, which can feel overwhelming with all its complex keywords, RizzLang simplifies programming using modern words. It’s the modern way to code—without all the confusion. Whether you’re a beginner or just want to have fun with coding, **RizzLang** is for you!

## Slang Dictionary

RizzLang uses slang to make coding more relatable and accessible. Here’s a list of common RizzLang keywords and their Python equivalents:

## Installation Guide for RizzLang

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- **Python 3.6+** installed on your system. If you don't have it, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- **pip** (Python’s package manager), which should come pre-installed with Python.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the RizzLang repository to your local machine using Git:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rizzlang.git
cd rizzlang
# Installation Guide for Rizz Programming Language

Follow the steps below to get Rizzlang and running on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.6+** installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need `pip` (Python's package manager) to install dependencies. `pip` should be installed automatically with Python.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the Rizz programming language repository to your local machine using Git.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
pip install termcolor (for Linux and Windows)
pip3 install termcolor (for MACOS)

## Step 3: Run the Rizzlang!

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start coding in rizzlang!
	1. Create a .rizz file (e.g., main.rizz) with your Rizz code (Syntax is exactly the same as python, Even though some old granpas will not be able to understand it

### Example Code in RizzLang

Here is an example of how you can write a function in RizzLang to check if a number is even or odd:

vibe check_even_odd(number):
    bet number % 2 == 0:
        rizz("Even")
    nocap:
        rizz("Odd")

check_even_odd(4)    # Should print "Even"
check_even_odd(7)    # Should print "Odd"

## Step 4: Running the code

MACOS: Go to your code then open the terminal. Type in "python3 rizz.py main.rizz" 
WINDOWS/LINUX: Go to your code then open the terminal. Type in "python rizz.py main.rizz" 
For the main.rizz part, just put your file name for the Rizzlang code.
Keep rizz.py the same

After you run the code, it will make a compiler.py, ignore this and you can delete it. The compiler.py will have the python translation 

## Step 5: Start coding!

Now you are ready to start coding!!!! Are you ready???
