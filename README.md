# Installation Guide for Rizz Programming Language

Follow the steps below to get Rizz up and running on your machine.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Python 3.6+** installed on your system. If not, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

You will also need `pip` (Python's package manager) to install dependencies. `pip` should be installed automatically with Python.

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the Rizz programming language repository to your local machine using Git.

## Step 3: Install Dependencies
pip install termcolor (for Linux and Windows)
pip3 install termcolor (for MACOS)

## Step 3: Run the Rizz Interpreter

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start coding in rizzlang!

Example:
	1. Create a .rizz file (e.g., main.rizz) with your Rizz code. Hereâ€™s a simple example of some code in Rizzlang:

flex "Hello, fam!"

vibe greet(name):
    bet name == "John":
        flex "Yo, John!"
    no cap:
        flex "Who's there?"

greet("John")
greet("Stranger")

## Step 4: Running the code

Go to your code then open the terminal. Type in "python3 rizz.py main.rizz"
For the main.rizz part, just put your file name for your code.
Keep rizz.py the same

After you run the code, it will make a compiler.py, ignore this and you can delete it. The compiler.py will have the python translation 

## Step 5: Start coding!

Now you are ready to start coding!!!! Are you ready???
